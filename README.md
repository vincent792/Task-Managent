# TASK MANAGER

## Overview

- A task management app is a web-based application that allows users to create, view, and manage tasks or to-do lists. In Django, a task management app can be built using the Django web framework, which provides features like model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, URL routing, forms handling, and database abstraction.

- In a typical Django task management app, users can create tasks with a title, description, due date, and status. The app allows users to view their tasks in a list view or a detailed view, sort and filter tasks by various criteria, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks. The app can also include user authentication and authorization, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their tasks in a secure way.

- Overall, a Django task management app can be a useful tool for individuals, teams, and organizations to stay organized, prioritize tasks, and stay on track with their work.
